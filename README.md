# RepairMate: Vehicle Damage Detection and Cost Estimation

This project provides an innovative solution to estimate the repair cost of a damaged car directly from an uploaded image. The model is deployed on AWS and can be accessed here (http://18.118.24.151:8501/).

# Key Features
We perform three main tasks:
**Car Part Identification**: Detects various car parts in the image (e.g., front bumper, door, wheel, etc.).<br>
**Damage Severity Assessment**: Classifies the intensity of the damage as minor, moderate, or severe.
**Repair Cost Estimation**: Calculates the repair cost based on the results from the car part identification and damage severity assessment.

**Deployment**
The application is deployed on AWS EC2 using Docker for scalability and accessibility.
